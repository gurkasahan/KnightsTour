# Knight's Tour - C# Console Application

This project is a hands-on implementation of the **Knightâ€™s Tour** problem in chess, where the knight visits every square on a chessboard exactly once. The solution is built using **C#** and explores **recursion** and **backtracking** as core problem-solving techniques.

## ðŸ§  Purpose

This project was developed to practice and deepen my understanding of:

- Recursive function design
- Backtracking algorithms
- Algorithmic problem-solving using C#
- Console-based application development

It serves as a foundational exercise to strengthen my skills in algorithm design and control flow in C#.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- **C#**
- **.NET Core Console App**
- **Visual Studio / VS Code**

## ðŸ“‚ Features

- Solves the Knightâ€™s Tour problem using recursion and backtracking.
- Can be extended to different board sizes.
- Outputs the move order of the knight across the board.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gurkasahan/KnightsTour.git
